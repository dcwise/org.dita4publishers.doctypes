  <title>Rendition Target Attribute Domain</title>
  <shortdesc>Provides a <xmlatt>props</xmlatt> specialization for flagging and filtering based on output type (e.g., PDF, EPUB, etc.).</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>The rendition target attribute domain (d4p_renditionTargetAttDomain) provides a single attribute, <xmlatt>d4p_renditionTarget</xmlatt>, that is intended to define the applicability of elements to specific output types (renditions), e.g., "pdf", "epub", "html", etc. The set of allowed values is not defined in the domain as the set of sensible values is unbounded and very dependent on your local processing requirements.</p>
