In essence, DITA lets us eat our cake and have it. Publishers can have publication models and topic types that are adapted to their specific needs yet still take advantage of all the modularity and reuse features of DITA when they are needed. Publishers can mix and match the simple (chapter) with the sophisticated (task) and choose from a growing library of special-purpose vocabulary modules, such as the DITA Learning and Training modules for representing assessments (test questions) and formal learning objects.
&lt;/p&gt;
