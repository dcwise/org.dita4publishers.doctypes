    &lt;title&gt;Relationship of the Role of Perceived Chance in Board Games and Players' Enjoyability&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;deck&gt;This paper investigates the relationship between board game players' perception of the significance of chance with their reported enjoyability of the board game. Players rated their perception of chance in affecting the outcome of the game on a scale of 1 to 10. They also used a ten point scale for rating how much they enjoyed each game.&lt;/deck&gt;
